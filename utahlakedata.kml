						In the Spring of 1820, Joseph Smith went into
						a grove of trees to know which church was true.
						It was here that Joseph Smith had the First Vision,
						where he saw God, the Father, and His son, Jesus Christ
						He was told none of the churches were true at the
						time. He was told he would be an instrumental part of
						restoring the fulness of the gospel to the earth again.
